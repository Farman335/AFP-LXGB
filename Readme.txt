++++++ How to reproduce the proposed model ++++++

1. DPC.csv, GAAC.csv,Sg3_PSSM_ACT.csv, and PseTS-PSSM.csv are the  feature sets of single feature descriptors.
2. DPC+Sg3_PSSM_ACT.csv, GAAC+DPC.csv, GAAC+DPC+Sg3_PSSM_ACT.csv, Sg3_PSSM_ACT+PseTS-PSSM.csv, All features are the  hybrid feature sets.
3. Best feature.csv is the set of best features.
4. Code for model training.py is used for model training and Code for model testing.py is used for model testing.
5. Model.pkl is the proposed model parameters file.
